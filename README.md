FOOD AND DRINKS
-Introduction:
The Food and Drink website is a project inspired by the challenges faced during the lockdown, where access to a variety of food and drinks became limited. The idea behind this platform is to create a service that can deliver any food or drink anywhere in the country, breaking geographical barriers and bringing culinary experiences to everyoneâ€™s doorstep

-Inspiration Behind the Project: 
During the lockdown, I saw the struggle many people faced in getting the food or drinks they craved, either due to restaurant closures or restrictions in their areas. This sparked the idea to build a platform where users could easily order food and drinks, regardless of location. The aim was to create a national delivery system that allows anyone to explore and order from a curatedmenu of meals and beverages, no matter where they are in the country.

The technical challenge I set for myself was to design a system capable of handling large-scale orders, ensuring efficient delivery tracking and seamless user interaction. Developing this project gave me a deeper understanding of responsive web design, back-end logic, and the complexities of integrating third-party APIs.
